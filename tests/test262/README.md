# brimstone-test26

Brimstone test runner for the official test262 test suite.

# Installation

The test runner requires the https://github.com/tc39/test262 repo. For consistency the test runner uses the test262 repo pinned to a specific commit. The current commit hash is:

`Dec 2 2022: 3d939ef566456d6a5609bcba48643b14177a77fe`.

Install the test262 repo at the pinned commit by running the following script:

```
./install_test262.sh
```
